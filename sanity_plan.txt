Combat
- Remove `enemies` usage; target from `state.npcs` where `attackable==True` and `alignment!='ally'`.
- On death: remove from `state.npcs`, award loot, set namespaced flags for uniques.



AI
- Iterate over hostile NPCs in `state.npcs` by `behavior` (pig, bear, etc.).

Maps
- Do not pass `noise_tiles` into MapDef; set tile metadata in `on_load` instead.
- Riddle room: torches as solid tiles + tile images; gold persistence flag `riddle_room.gold_taken`.
- Forest C: leaves as `map_noise_tiles` + tile images; expand placements; bear persists with `forest_c.bear_dead`.
- Forest B: pig persists with `forest_b.pig_dead`.


Done in this pass
- Alignment + attackable on Entity.
- Unified to `state.npcs` for combat/AI; added tile rendering and triggers.
- Namespaced flags and persistence for pig/bear/gold. Bunny spawn capped to 20.
- More noisy tiles in Forest C; torches as solid tiles + images; leaves as noise tiles + images.

Next
- Optional: render special solid tiles with custom sprites distinct from walls.
