Forest Expansion TODO
---------------------

- Forest A/B/C/D maps added and connected:
  - A east→D, north→B; B east→C; C south→D; D west→A, east→Bunny Area.
- Forest B: one Pig (charges within 10 tiles; bites 1 dmg if adjacent).
- Forest C: sleeping Bear + scattered leaves (noise triggers wake bear).
- Trapper trades: rabbit(1), pig(50), bear(200).
- Assets generated: pig.png, bear.png, torch.png, leaves.png.

Follow-ups
- Adjust encounter balance (pig speed, bear damage).
- Consider auto-key transparency for fallback-generated sprites.
- Expand shops with items to handle new areas (e.g., traps, bait).
